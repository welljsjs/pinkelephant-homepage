If you encounter any issues, or\nyour site leverages more advanced gatsby configuration, check to see if it's\ncovered in the\n[official Gatsby v3 migration guide](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/migrating-from-v2-to-v3/).\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\nNote: We'll use yarn for the shell commands here. Replace them with the `npm`\nequivalent if your project uses `npm` as its package manager.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n1. Update Gatsby to v3\n   ```\n   yarn add gatsby@latest-v3\n   ```\n2. Update gatsby plugins (including the theme)\n   ```\n   yarn upgrade-interactive --latest\n   ```\n3. Check to see if you're using `sizes` or `resolutions` with `gatsby-image`. Do\n   a project wide search for `gatsby-image`. Check to make sure that you're not\n   using these\n   [deprecated props](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/migrating-from-v2-to-v3/#removal-of-sizes--resolutions-for-image-queries)\n4. Check your Sass (and potentially JSON) to ensure they're imported as ES\n   Modules. \"Default exports\" are no longer supported.\n\n   ```js path=Before\n   import styles from './MySpan.module.scss';\n   import metadata from './metadata.json';\n   const MySpan = () => <span className={styles.mySpan} />;\n   ```\n\n   ```js path=After\n   import { mySpan } from './MySpan.module.scss';\n   // Or import * as styles from './MySpan.module.scss'\n   import * as metadata from './metadata.json';\n   const MySpan = () => <span className={mySpan} />;\n   ```\n\n5. Make sure to update the path of your shadowed components (Footer and Header).\n   - Create a folder each for `Footer` and `Header`.\n   - Change the file name to `index.js` inside each corresponding folder. More\n     info can be found in the\n     [shadowing docs](https://gatsby-theme-carbon.vercel.app/guides/shadowing/#shadowing-basics)\n6. If you have a custom webpack config, be sure your config is compatible with\n   [Webpack 5](https://webpack.js.org/migrate/5/) (the version Gatsby 3 uses)\n7. Run `npx gatsby clean` to delete your projects development bundle\n8. Run `yarn dev`\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n- Try deleting your node_modules, running `yarn cache clean` and `yarn install`\n  (or `npm cache clean --force` and npm install)\n- Feel free to reach out in the #gatsby-theme-carbon slack channel or open an\n  issue on GitHub\n  ","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"3b40a5a1f89ee0db48430c18c95898aa","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":178},"frontmatter":{"title":"V2.0 Migration","description":"Guide for migrating to v2.0 of the theme"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: V2.0 Migration\ndescription: Guide for migrating to v2.0 of the theme\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nThis update introduces several big improvements to Gatsby sites including\nincremental builds, fast refresh, and image processing.
